<span class="stevie_body">We’ve been working with Stephen for several years now. His design work is top-notch and highly creative, and he is very responsive and attentive to detail.  Stephen is also quite knowledgeable about the inner-workings of the Internet, SEO, etc., which has proven very helpful.</span><span class="client_date">4+ Continuous Years</span></p>

<span class="stevie_body"><span class="quote">“Awesome! Whenever you are free to talk. Good job dude!”</span> We’d drifted for months and the web development people before Stephen weren’t making any progress. Right from the start Stephen clicked with me and we built the site and got it done. He did a great job in tough circumstances.</span><span class="client_date">Winter 2016</span></p>

<span class="stevie_body">We selected Stephen from several developers. He knew what he was talking about and had a good plan to get it done. We had a tight timetable to get the site done – twice! And both times he met the dates. He’s great to work with and has good views on what to do that he explains and then incorporates our feedback. He’s got a great process and we have a great site too.</span><span class="client_date">Winter 2016</span></p>

<p><span class="stevie_body">I would like to express my appreciation for your hard work, smarts and dedication to getting our site live. We spent months with other developers and got nowhere. You stepped in, worked with me to establish the final design and ultimately executed until we were up and running.</span><span class="client_date">Winter 2016</span></p>

<span class="stevie_body">Stephen was great to work with. He listened to what we needed, explained what he was about to do – and then he did it. He took our guidance all the time. It’s a great site and we love it!</span><span class="client_date">Winter 2016</span></p>

<span class="stevie_body">Stephen developed 4 different sites for us all based on one site, and before that he did our previous site too. It was a smart way to attack the problem. He was very focused, easy to talk to and really responsive. I use him all the time and will continue.</span><span class="client_date"> Summer 2015</span></p>
