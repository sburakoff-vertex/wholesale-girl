                        <p> When LeadersUp approached us, they already had a website in place. This website, however,
                            didn’t quite speak to stakeholders, leaving some members of the target audience out of the
                            brand’s value statement. During our initial project discovery phase, we realized that the
                            LeadersUp homepage would have to quickly pivot towards one of the four stakeholder types to
                            offer audience-specific information. </p>

                        <p> As a result, we went with a brief homepage design focusing on a video background that
                            reinforces brand value. From that point, users are encouraged to click on the link that best
                            represents their interests: recruiting, impact, employer or community information.</p>

                        <p> We held bi-weekly meetings with LeadersUp over a period of three months to keep our work in
                            line with the company’s goals. Each of the four main pages underwent significant design
                            iterations before being finalized with a polished page design that offered matched corporate
                            branding at every point of contact.</p>

                        <p> Importantly, LeadersUp is more than a recruitment service for Starbucks. It integrates with
                            communities in order to bridge the gap between youth unemployment and opportunity division.
                            Our site needed to make it clear that LeadersUp invests itself in giving young adults the
                            tools and opportunities they need to succeed in rewarding careers.</p>
